Azure Blob Storage is a scalable, cost-effective cloud storage solution provided by Microsoft Azure.
It is designed to store large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.
Blob Storage is ideal for serving images or documents directly to a browser, storing files for distributed access, streaming video and audio, writing to log files, and storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.

It supports three types of blobs: block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs, each optimized for different storage scenarios.
With features like tiered storage, lifecycle management, and secure access, Azure Blob Storage helps organizations manage their data efficiently and securely.

It integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, making it a versatile choice for developers and IT professionals.
